## Becoming a Collaborator

It's easy to become a collaborator! Familiarity with Killer Queen and an interest in furthering stats development is all it takes.

If you are a member of the [Killer Queen Slack server](https://kqchat.slack.com/), you can reach out to `@Kevin Snyder`, or email [kevin.snyder.codes@gmail.com](mailto:kevin.snyder.codes@gmail.com), to discuss becoming a collaborator. If you haven't shown prior interest in stats development, then a quick conversation about ideas you have and demonstrable coding experience will be enough to grant you collaborator status.

We have a channel on the Slack server, `#stats-dev`, where we discuss stats development. You can find other collaborators there to discuss the project with and share ideas.

We want to enhance the Killer Queen experience in many ways. When it comes to new ideas and features, the sky's the limit, so don't be shy to talk with us and become a collaborator!

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are mandatory for all changes entering the master branch. They must be approved by at least one project owner. **Pushing to master, including force pushes, is disabled for collaborators.**

You can open a pull request from a fork of the project, or from another branch on the project if you're a collaborator. The benefit of being a collaborator and opening a pull request from another branch on the project is that if you decide to stop working on the branch, someone else can continue where you left off and bring your changes to a state where they will be accepted into the master branch.

If your pull request fixes an open issue, we recommend including the "Fixes #_x_" language in the description or a commit, where _x_ is the issue number. This way, when your pull request is merged, the issue will automatically be closed. More about this [here](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/).

## Issues

Issues are a place to report bugs and discuss new features or enhancements. There are no strict rules around the format of an issue. However, we suggest adding appropriate labels to your issue.

If you would like to tackle an issue, whether one you created or someone else's, feel free to add yourself as an assignee.
